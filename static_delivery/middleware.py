    Middleware to serve static files from within Django.

    In some setups it is a good idea to serve static files from Django and have
    them cached in a reverse proxy like Nginx or something similar.

    By doing this, we can easily serve static files from our - for example - our
    Docker image without putting them in a shared volume.

    It is important to know that serving files from Django directly won't perform
    very well. Always have a cache in front of it.

    Additionally, the middleware is able to recover from invalid hashes in static
    file names when you use a staticfiles storage with name hashing in place.
    If a file with a certain hash is unavailable, the middleware will try to
    look up the correct hash for the file.
